# Loss-Functions
Loss Functions Compendium: Explore a comprehensive collection of machine learning and deep learning loss functions, with explanations and code examples for various tasks and applications.

Creating a single GitHub repository that comprehensively covers all possible topics under "Loss Functions" may not be practical, as there are numerous loss functions used in various machine learning and deep learning tasks. However, I can provide a structure for a repository that can serve as a resource hub for learning about and implementing different loss functions:
